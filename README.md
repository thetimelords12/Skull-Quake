# Skull-Quake
A look inside my creation of a skully Quake map.

## Summary
This Git follows my path and steps taken to creating a level in Quake. Grabbing inspiration from designs from comics and such, I am creating a two-four player competetive multiplayer level for Quake named Spider's Skull. The inspirations are derived from the two designs of the 2099 Spider-man symbols, and merging them together to create a map that can allow for some symmetry all the while allowing for diversity through the design.
